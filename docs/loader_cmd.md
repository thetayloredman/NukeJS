# CommandLoaders

CommandLoaders take care of loading, handling and parsing commands. Without them, your Bot wouldn't be capable of recognizing commands!

CommandLoaders give you the freedom and joy of being able to initialize many of them. This allows you to make two seperate command systems. As an example you could have staff use the prefix "n>" and users use "s>" and so they wouldn't mix up.

CommandLoaders recursively scan directories and load all commands located in them. If you allow the Loader to set the first sub Folder as Categories, it will read the folders
Moderation -> Admins -> delete.js
delete.js would be added to the category Moderation, unless predefined in the command itself

## initialization

A basic CommandLoader would be

```js
const normalCommands = new nukejs.CommandLoader(client, { directory: './commands', prefix: 'n>' });
```

CommandLoaders have many options you can play with!

## Guild Specific Prefixes

If you want to have a guild specific prefix, you can accomplish this, by instead of a literal string in the prefix section, you add in a function that returns a string.
For example with Mongoose:

```js
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
import Guild from './database/models/GuildConfig';

let commandLoader = new CommandLoader(client, {
    directory: './dist/commands',
    prefix: async (message) => {
        return (await mongoose.model('GuildConfig').findOne({ id: message.guild.id }).exec()).get('prefix');
    }
});
```

## Reloading commands

Every CommandLoader has a reload() function, this function clears the CommandLoader and reloads all commands. To use this, you need to define CommandLoader as a global variable and run that function in your self made reload command

## Events

Every Loader comes with its own set of Events, you can catch those Events and handle them however you wish!

| Event     | when                                           | data                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| loaded    | Emitted whenever a command is emitted          | path: Path to Command File                            |
| malformed | Emitted whenever a malformed command was found | path: Path to Command File                            |
| executed  | Emitted whenever a command is executed         | command: Command name                                 |
| cmd_error | executed whenever an error occurs              | command: Command Name; error: Error that was received |
