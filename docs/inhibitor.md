# Inhibitor

Inhibitors are like blockers that run before a command is actually executed. This can be useful if you want to make custom bot perms checks or maybe have a blacklist.

```js
const { Inhibitor } = require('nukejs');

module.exports = class extends Inhibitor {
    constructor() {
        super({
            name: 'blacklist',
            enabled: true
        });
    }

    async run(message, command, loaderName) {
        const blacklist = ['731670025873915965'];
        return blacklist.includes(message.author.id);
    }
};
```

In the run parameters, message returns the received message, command is the Command the User run in form of a Command object. The loaderName is the name of the loader the command that is being executed is run in. Keep in mind if you didn't define a name for the loader, that parameter will be "".
