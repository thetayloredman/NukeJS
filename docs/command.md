# Commands

To create a Command, you need to input this into a new js file that is located in the command directory you set the Loader to!

```js
const { Command } = require('nukejs');

module.exports = class extends Command {
    constructor(file) {
        super(file, {
            name: '',
            runIn: ['text']
        });
    }

    async run(message, args, client) {}
};
```
